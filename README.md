# Intruduction

This is an experimental exercise using pyautogui. It consists of giving images named in alphabetical order to the program, asking it to find them on screen, then clicking it. I chose to name them using numbers, but feel free to use any naming system of your preference. Just be sure to name actions in the correct order.
That is to say, click on image 1.jpg, then 2.jpg and so on. Or maybe, a.png, b.png, on and on.

# Before Run
Make sure you have the requirements installed in your current environment. It's possible to do that by running the following command on terminal while inside the src folder.

`pip -r requirements.txt`

# Run

Inside src folder, on terminal, type the following command

| Linux           | Windows        |
|-----------------|----------------|
|`python3 main.py`|`python main.py`|
